🚀 Meteor Mash

Dodge. Catch. Survive.
The alien menace is dropping fiery meteors and it’s your job to protect Earth with only three hovering platforms!

Meteor Mash is a fast paced, retro inspired arcade game where timing and reflexes are everything. Inspired by the classic Atari hit Kaboom!, this cosmic remix throws you into space with modern polish and old school charm.

🎉 This is my first ever game, so I’m very open to feedback!
Whether it's bugs, balance, or ideas, I'd love to hear what you think!
